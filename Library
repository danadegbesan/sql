Cooper argues that numerous secret societies exist, which were organized into a single massive society c. 1953; that a Secret Government, which controls everything, was established shortly after World War II; that the government seeks to eliminate population through various means and that extra-terrestrial intelligent life exists and often visits earth.

'In Adventure Capitalist, legendary investor Jim Rogers proves that the best way to profit from the global situation is to see the world mile by mile. Behind the wheel of a sunburst-yellow, custom-built convertible Mercedes, Rogers and his fiancee, Paige Parker, began their "Millennium Adventure" on January 1, 1999, from Iceland. They traveled through 116 countries, including many where most have rarely ventured, such as Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, Angola, Sudan, Congo, Colombia, and East Timor. They drove through war zones, deserts, jungles, epidemics, and blizzards. They had many narrow escapes. They camped with nomads and camels in the western Sahara. They ate silkworms, iguanas, snakes, termites, guinea pigs, porcupines, crocodiles, and grasshoppers. Best of all, they saw the real world from the ground up--the only vantage point from which it can be truly understood--economically, politically, and socially.',
